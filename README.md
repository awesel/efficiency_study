# Efficiency Study

Code availability for a study testing whether efficiency is a moral foundation. This was conducted by Andrew Wesel at UCSB's Summer Research Academies. Advised by Musa Malik, Brittany Wheeler, and Sungbin Youk.

This only has the stuff for study 2. In study 1, we only used established methods and statistical tests so the code is uninteresting.

Please reach out for a video of the presentation or the manuscript! I cannot publish these materials publicly due to the research being property of UCSB.
