# Efficiency Study

Code availability for the study testing whether efficiency is a moral foundation

This only has the stuff for study 2. In study 1, we only used established methods and statistical tests so the code is uninteresting.

Please reach out for a video of the presentation or the manuscript! I cannot publish these materials publicly due to the research being property of UCSB.
